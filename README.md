# heartbeat_cpp_v2

RobotX 2022 heartbeat system developed for raspberry PI.

This system was built and tested on windows and deployed on PI and therefore is designed to be cross-platform. As such, the make-files and other config files are not included in this repository and must be added locally.

Unfortunately this means a few steps are in order to get this running, including:

  - lib must be added to main as a dependency
